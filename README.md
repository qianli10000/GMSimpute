# GTSimpute

This R package implements the Two-Step Lasso (TS-Lasso) and compound minimum to recover the abundance of missing peaks in mass spectrum analysis. TS-Lasso is a label-free imputation method that handles various types of missing peaks simultaneously. This package provides the procedure to generate missing peaks (or data)  for simulation study, as well as a tool to estimate and visualize the proportion of missing at random.
